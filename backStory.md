#Back Story

All good ideas have a back story. Well, all ideas, regardless of quality have a backstory.

This idea started after [SirCharlesWatson](https://github.com/sircharleswatson) and [Brian Ball](https://github.com/ideabrian) met in a chatroom for [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com)

Sir Charles was live - chatting while attending a Meetup focused on [MeteorJS](http://www.meteor.com)

Over the next two days, they finished the Simple-Todo app that stands in as the tutorial for getting started with Meteor.
Then, on the Saturday (Nov. 22, 2014) they decided to stay in and code instead of being out in the elements.
As they discussed learning resources and ideas, they tossed around a few ideas.

Realizing their main goal was to learn by building, they decided to build a tool that would help them objectively evaluate ideas for collaborative efforts.

"Hey, you know the card game WAR?" asked Brian.
"ya"
"Well, we could do that for ideas. We each toss out an idea with a short description. Then, we vote.
Unless we each agree on the idea, we can expand the idea with three bullet points - then vote again."

The initial concept flow goes like this:

1. Each enter an idea and some bullet points that help provide perspective.
2. Vote and/or discuss  maybe + ? -   (where the ? means I don't understand and the +/- mean yay / nay.
3. Repeat until you both have some enthusiasm for the same idea.

###Thoughts:
+Maybe there's a way to each say what you think the other idea is like before voting. If somebody adds to your idea in a way that makes it sound unappealing, you can down-vote your own idea.
